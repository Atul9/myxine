# `myxine`: a friendly eel to help you get _GUI_ fast

The hagfish, _myxine glutinosa_, is a sea creature who hasn't changed much since well before dinosaurs roamed the planet. If it ain't broke, don't fix it! These creatures are best known for their ability to generate copious amounts of slime in short order.

Taking these "slime eels" as its namesake, `myxine` helps reduce the usual friction associated with creating a graphical interface for a script: letting you _get GUI fast_.
